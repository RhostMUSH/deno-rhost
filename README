This is a library for Deno[1] to make it easier to write execscript scripts for
RhostMUSH[2], by pre-processing the myriad environment variables, and giving a
print() function that munges Unicode into the Rhost-native markup.

Sample of use:

const Rhost = await import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevensmedia/deno-rhost/master/rhost.js")
try {
	var environment = Rhost.environment()
	Rhost.print(`You are using a server with execscript version: ${Rhost.environment.version}`)
} catch(e) {
	Rhost.print("Failed parsing Rhost execscript data")
	Rhost.print(e)
}
